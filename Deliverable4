Project: RiotWatcher

Carson Smith Casey Brenard  Daniel Feliciano

Task: Complete the design and implementation of your testing framework as specified in Deliverable #3.
You are now ready to test your project in earnest. You will create 25 test cases that your framework 
will automatically use to test your H/FOSS project.

Experiences:
  We have chosen RiotWatcher, a wrapper for the Riot Game API for League Of 
  Legends, as our new project.
  Our 25 test cases are derived from the following 5 methods:
      static_get_item
      static_get_summoner_spell
      static_get_mastery
      static_get_champion
      static_get_rune
